# Description #

A very simple AppleScript that toggles
[Isolator](http://willmore.eu/software/isolator/) and DND mode on my
IM clients.

# Running #

The way I run the script is by first compiling it into an app (`osacompile -o run_isolate.app
isolate.applescript`) and placing it in `/Applications`. Then I use
[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) to activate it. Spotlight search works too.
